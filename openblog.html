          When assuming the role of president at Tarleton State, it was clear
          that the university had a proud legacy with unbridled potential. With
          cherished traditions and unwavering support in place, we outlined a
          vision for the future — a vision that would honor our past while
          guiding us to new heights. To reach our goals, we needed to understand
          the heart of this institution: the people. In meeting with students,
          faculty, staff, alumni, and community members, their stories, hopes,
          and dreams for Tarleton State inspired our path forward.

      <p class="top-margin" id="para">
        Our strategic plan, Tarleton Forward 2030, was born out of the desire to
        create a lasting impact. It was designed to carry us through the next
        decade, coinciding with our 10-year reaffirmation by the Southern
        Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC). I
        wanted a plan that would guide us until 2030, positioning Tarleton State
        as the premier comprehensive university in the nation. As we were
        finalizing the details, none of us could have predicted the storm that
        was about to hit. By March 2020, the world was grappling with the
        COVID-19 pandemic, and everything we thought we knew about the future
        was suddenly uncertain.
        <br /><br />
        Many leaders might have paused their plans, but I felt a conviction deep
        in my gut: we had to move forward. The pandemic, with all its
        challenges, couldn’t be allowed to dictate the next decade for Tarleton
        State. We had a momentum that I wasn’t willing to lose. Faculty, staff,
        students, and community stakeholders had already bought into our vision,
        and I didn’t want to let fear of the unknown take that away. We pressed
        forward, using our strategic plan as an anchor in the storm.
        <br /><br />
        What I didn’t expect was how much the plan would mean to our community
        during those dark days. Faculty members would stop to thank me for
        continuing. They told me that working on the plan allowed them to take
        their minds off the pandemic and to dream again. It gave us all hope — a
        sense that no matter what was happening in the world, we had control
        over our future. And that’s what leadership is about, isn’t it? Offering
        hope when the outlook is bleak, and giving people something to work
        toward, even when the path ahead is uncertain.

        Turning Challenges into Opportunities

        The journey hasn’t been without its hurdles. There were moments when we
        questioned whether we were aiming too high. But I’ve always believed
        that courageous leadership means setting a vision that stretches beyond
        where you are today. It’s about looking five or ten years down the road
        and saying, “This is where we want to be,” even if you don’t have all
        the answers right now. It’s about betting on your team, on your
        community, and on your future.
        <br /><br />
        Our bold decisions have already begun to pay off. We’ve outpaced our
        projected growth, which has brought its own set of challenges — like
        having more students than we have housing for. But these are good
        problems to have. We’re managing active construction projects and
        planning for the future, all while maintaining the momentum we’ve built.
        <br /><br />
        We recently announced the launch of a feasibility study to create the
        College of Osteopathic Medicine. This means more than just new programs;
        it’s a game-changer for our university and the State of Texas. We are
        addressing a critical need for primary care physicians, particularly in
        rural areas. The new college aligns perfectly with our strategic goals,
        from enhancing student success to making a meaningful economic impact on
        our region. It’s the kind of initiative that sets Tarleton State apart
        and positions us as a leader in higher education.

      <p class="top-margin" id="lower-heading">Courageous Leadership</p>
      <p class="top-margin" id="para">
        Looking back, I realize that every step we’ve taken over the past few
        years has been guided by a single principle: courage. Courage to set a
        bold vision, courage to move forward when it would have been easier to
        stand still, and courage to inspire others to believe in themselves and
        in their ability to achieve more than they ever thought possible.
        <br /><br />
        That’s what I believe courageous leadership is all about. It’s not just
        about making decisions for today — it’s about casting a vision for
        tomorrow and rallying others to help make that vision a reality. It’s
        about empowering people to see beyond their current circumstances and to
        believe in their potential to create something better.
        <br /><br />
        At Tarleton State, we’re not just here to help people survive, we’re
        here to help them flourish. As president, it’s my responsibility to make
        sure that every decision we make and every plan we create, moves us
        closer to that goal. Because in the end, it’s not just about being a
        good leader — it’s about seeing an organization’s potential and having
        the courage to help a community realize that potential.
